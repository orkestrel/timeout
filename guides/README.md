# Guides

A dual-axis index into this repository's guides — by concept, and by directory (AGENTS §22).

## By concept

| Concept  | Spec                                 | Source                    | Tests                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Markdown | [`src/markdown.md`](src/markdown.md) | [`src/core`](../src/core) | [`tests/src/core`](../tests/src/core) |

## By directory

| Directory  | Guide                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `src/core` | [`src/markdown.md`](src/markdown.md) |

## Dependency reference

[`src/contract.md`](src/contract.md) is a byte-identical mirror of the guide for
`@orkestrel/contract` — this package's sole runtime dependency. It documents
**that package's** surface (guards, combinators, parsers, and the shape DSL), not
anything sourced in this repo; it is kept here so a reader of the markdown AST
guards, leaf-node shapes, and compiled contracts (`isMarkdownNode`,
`createTextContract`, …) can see the primitives they are built from without
leaving this guide set.

[`src/guide.md`](src/guide.md) is a byte-identical mirror of the guide for
`@orkestrel/guide` — the devDependency powering this repo's guides-parity test
suite (`tests/guides/src/parity.test.ts`). It documents **that package's**
surface (`Guide` / `Source`, the manifest and comparison helpers), not anything
sourced in this repo; it is kept here so a reader of the parity suite can see
the primitives it is built from without leaving this guide set.
